# 60 seconds pitch

Hi, I'm Slawa - a web-developer currently working at Nintendo.

Everybody has an electricity meter in their home. And most of us only check it once a year - when it's time pay the bill. I'd like to build a cheap solution allowing you to see your electricity consumption on your smart-phone real-time.

Hardware is a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with a camera pointed at the electricity meter.

Software gets an image from the camera and extracts the current value using computer vision and machine learning. The values are stored in the database.

I have a prototype working at my home already. Now we need to make it a business.

The project is rather small and straightforward - what could possibly go wrong?

BTW, I had failed two other start-ups in the past.

Thank you.
